Report – Inlämningsuppgift 2
Both my exercises are tied to the final project. Thus, in both reports there may be things that are repeated or similar. 
The project I have developed is divided in two main parts: a game and a website. The game covers the CI part with the CircleCI pipeline, and the testing and the website is where the CD happens, as the new versions of the game are deployed automatically to the website (which will be the main focus in this report).
As explained in the report number 1, the game is written in Python and the code is hosted in Github, where I updated it as soon as I changed something. I have been working with Visual Studio Code as I find it the easiest IDE to work with. 
The first problem I encountered was when I tried to add/commit/push via the Visual Studio terminal, where I got errors all the time. After consulting with my teacher and failing to fix the error for a while, he noticed that the problem was as simple as working in the wrong directory. That problem never arose again and I have been getting way more confident since then about working directly with Github (even after the version control course that we took I did not feel like I could do that without thinking a lot). 
When it comes to writing tests, in order to not repeat myself more, I want to redirect the reader to the report number 1, as I explain the issues I had with testing. [https://github.com/Nidstaang/CICD1/blob/main/report_upp1.md]
Testing (in this case, unit testing) works by checking that single chunks of code, functions, work properly. This is useful when the code is in constant development, as it may make something crash and testing might help you locate the error or occasional bugs and fix them.
When in comes to linting, I used Flake8 as the linter in the website part and it had no problem in passing (after I fixed a few extra/missing white lines and the such).
I did not test the website code as I read that one does not do that with HTML code. I am not 100% sure that is true but having used unit testing in another part of the code I considered that was enough. 
When it comes to the CircleCI pipeline, it was fairly easy to create once I understood what every command was. Still, I had some problems when it comes to making it work, as it gave me error all the time. I finally realised there was an extra space in the yml file. When I found it and fixed it, the pipeline had no problems in running. As it did not involve testing, the pipeline for the website was very easy to build. 
The assignment tells us to use automation framework and I have used this in my project by writing a batch script that turns the file where the game is (a .py file) into an .exe file. The script runs every day at 13:37 and substitutes the old file in a folder that syncs every day with g-drive as well. That folder and file are then linked to the website, so every time the game file is updated the final .exe game will update as well, making those who go into the website always get the latest version (at least the day-old latest version). 
That automation process works more or less as well for a hypothetical CD, but if we wanted to achieve a full proper CD one should implement a CD process to deploy the website as well.
